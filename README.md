# Deep Generative Models

This repository contains four projects related to the course of _Deep Generative Models_ at _Ghent University_. All the projects are made in collaboration with another Erasmus student. 

1. Lab 2 regards _Autoregressive models_ amd comsists in the implementation of an **RNN**.
2. Lab 3 is about implementing a **Variational Autoencoder** a $\beta$-**VAE** and a **Discrete VAE**.
3. In lab 4 we implemented a **GAN** and a **WGAN**.
4. Lab 5 is about building a **Normalizing Flow**.
